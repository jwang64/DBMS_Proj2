CSCI4370 Project 2 Report - Peter Choi

For this project, I implemented all the methods that were required in the LinHashMap.java file.
Some issues I faced dealt mostly with the lack of knowledge of how hashing works. I ended up looking up
a couple of videos, and did some of my own research to understand what hashing was. Another problem I had was
trying to understand what we were required to do with the Table.java file. It was brought up that there were 
blank methods reserved for the hashing and btree joins, but we were not to implement them. After I changed the value
of the mType, everything seemed to work fine. Some of the test cases that I considered was the possiblity of a negative 
key value. I solved this by normalizing the key value. Overall, this project should not have been too difficult, but was 
made more difficult through the lack of information we were given. That being said, TA's and the professor in the forums 
aided me to know what we were supposed to do.
